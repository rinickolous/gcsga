# GURPS Character Sheet Game Aid for FoundryVTT

This system aims to aid GMs and players in playing on FoundryVTT using the GURPS system.
The system is closely tied with the [GURPS Character Sheet by Richard Wilkes].

## Installation

The system is currently under early development and its installation and use in play is not recommended.

## Development

To Do...

### Prerequisites

In order to build this system, recent versions of `node` and `npm` are
required. Most likely, using `yarn` also works, but only `npm` is officially
supported. We recommend using the latest lts version of `node`. If you use `nvm`
to manage your `node` versions, you can simply run

```
nvm install
```

in the project's root directory.

You also need to install the project's dependencies. To do so, run

```
npm install
```

### Building

You can build the project by running

```
npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can run

```
npm run build:watch
```

to watch for changes and automatically build as necessary.

### Linking the built project to Foundry VTT

In order to provide a fluent development experience, it is recommended to link
the built system to your local Foundry VTT installation's data folder. In
order to do so, first add a file called `foundryconfig.json` to the project root
with the following content:

```
{
  "dataPath": "/absolute/path/to/your/FoundryVTT"
}
```

(if you are using Windows, make sure to use `\` as a path separator instead of
`/`)

Then run

```
npm run link-project
```

On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, so unfortunately
you need to run the above command in an administrator terminal for it to work.

### Running the tests

You can run the tests with the following command:

```
npm test
```

### Creating a release

The workflow works basically the same as the workflow of the [League Basic JS Module Template], please follow the
instructions given there.
