# TO DO
## In Progress
- Roll chat templates

	- ChatCommand for rolling
	- Modifier parsing

 - PDF Support
 - GGA 0.15 integration
	- add posture to dynamic character
	- add maneuver to dynamic character
	- add non-attribute resource trackers to dynamic character (optional, could think of better solution)
	- add move modes to dynamic character
	- add move advantage parsing (by name? or feature? or VTT notes?) for "Flight", "Walk on Air".
	the names pased should be customizable via an object-type system setting. the names(?) value should be an array of strings
	- add optional encumbrance to dynamic character
	- add deprecation/migration warning to static character
	- modify static charsheet to match stylistically with dynamic charsheet. also eliminate "editable" static charsheet, instead using same system as dynamic
	- add deprecation warning to static items
	- (?) add optional reeling to dynamic character (maybe add ability to manually switch pool state for purposes of move etc. calculation)
